					<h3>Development</h3>
					<p>When evaluating software for a particular purpose, it is often the case that existing solutions
						almost cover your specific needs. It is this <i>„almost“</i> which can cause significant
						problems and costs when implementing new software in your organization, since it may require
						altering your business processes in order to be compatible with the way the software process
						requires.<br/>
						<br/>
						In any complex organization, existing business processes are the result of conscious and
						unconscious optimization processes over time. Since every company works slightly differently,
						standard software can only suit your business processes to a certain degree.<br/>
						<br/>
						The goal must thus be to close this gap between desire and reality. Rather than changing your
						business processes, Innovation Brigade offers you development services which adapts software to
						your specific needs.<br/>
						<br/>
						Whether you need a custom application which is entirely specific to you or changes to an
						existing solution in order to adapt it your needs, Innovation Brigade has the know-how and
						skills to provide you with a system which works according to your specific requirements. Doing
						so, allows your organization to retain it's successful processes and keep utilizing the skills
						upon which your business depends and which your customers have come to expect and ensures that
						you retain the operational efficiency you have acquired over the years. Utilize the efficiency
						you have acquired over the years and inspire your customers with improved services.</p>
